## - Sorting Algorithm
      -  Selection Sort
      step 1 Set minimum value to array[0] aka index = position  | > 0 < | 1 | 2| ....| >
      step 2 search the minimum element in the array
      step 3 swap with value in min variable
      step 4 increment min variable to point to next level

      - Insertion Sort
      step 1 initialize two index i and j and set i = 1 and j = i-1 < | j | i | | | | | | | | | >
      step 2 declare a variable k where located arr[i]
      step 3 iterate over arr and where k is minus than arr[j] swap them
      step 4 again iterate until all previous number are minus expect arr[k]
      step 5 go ahead and repeat step 2 ~ 4 until array is sorted
